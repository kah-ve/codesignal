Consider a special family of Engineers and Doctors. This family has the following rules:

Everybody has two children.
The first child of an Engineer is an Engineer and the second child is a Doctor.
The first child of a Doctor is a Doctor and the second child is an Engineer.
All generations of Doctors and Engineers start with an Engineer.
We can represent the situation using this diagram:

                E

          E           D

Given the level and position of a person in the ancestor tree above, find the profession of the person.
