Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, determine whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array where nums[i] = nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is less than or equal to k.

Example

For nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2] and k = 3, the output should be
containsCloseNums(nums, k) = true.

There are two 2s in nums, and the absolute difference between their positions is exactly 3.

For nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2] and k = 2, the output should be
containsCloseNums(nums, k) = false.

The absolute difference between the positions of the two 2s is 3, which is more than k
