Note: Avoid using built-in std::nth_element (or analogous built-in functions in languages other than C++) when solving this challenge. Implement them yourself, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. This will be the kth largest element in sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
