Given an encoded string, return its corresponding decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is repeated exactly k times. Note: k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

Note that your solution should have linear complexity because this is what you will be asked during an interview.
