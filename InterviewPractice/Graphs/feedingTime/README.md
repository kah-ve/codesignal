You are the head zookeeper at a large zoo. You've been contacted by schools in the area that want to bring in classes so that students can feed the animals. The animals can only be fed once a day, so no two classes can come on the same day if they want to feed the same animals.

You have a list classes, such that classes[i] is a list of animals that the ith class wants to feed. Classes i and j cannot come on the same day if an animal in classes[i] also appears in classes[j] (for i â‰  j). Your job is to determine the minimum number of days you would need to have all the classes come to feed the animals if they can all come within 5 days. If it isn't possible for all the classes to come within 5 days, return -1 instead.
