Given two binary trees t1 and t2, determine whether the second tree is a subtree of the first tree. A subtree for vertex v in a binary tree t is a tree consisting of v and all its descendants in t. Determine whether or not there is a vertex v (possibly none) in tree t1 such that a subtree for vertex v (possibly empty) in t1 equals t2.
