Note: Your solution should have only one BST traversal and O(1) extra space complexity, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview.

A tree is considered a binary search tree (BST) if for each of its nodes the following is true:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and the right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Given a binary search tree t, find the kth smallest element in it.

Note that kth smallest element means kth element in increasing order. See examples for better understanding.

Example

For  
   3  
 /   \  
1     5  
     / \  
    4   6  

the output should be
kthSmallestInBST(t, k) = 5.
