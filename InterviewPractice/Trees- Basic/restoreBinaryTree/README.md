Note: Your solution should have O(inorder.length) time complexity, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview.

Let's define inorder and preorder traversals of a binary tree as follows:

Inorder traversal first visits the left subtree, then the root, then its right subtree;
Preorder traversal first visits the root, then its left subtree, then its right subtree.
For example, if tree looks like this:

    1
   / \
  2   3
 /   / \
4   5   6
then the traversals will be as follows:

Inorder traversal: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6]
Preorder traversal: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6]
Given the inorder and preorder traversals of a binary tree t, but not t itself, restore t and return it.
