Note: Your solution should have O(inorder.length) time complexity, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview.

Let's define inorder and preorder traversals of a binary tree as follows:

Inorder traversal first visits the left subtree, then the root, then its right subtree;
Preorder traversal first visits the root, then its left subtree, then its right subtree.

Given the inorder and preorder traversals of a binary tree t, but not t itself, restore t and return it.
