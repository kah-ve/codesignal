Note: Try to solve this task without using recursion, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a binary tree of integers t, return its node values in the following format:

The first element should be the value of the tree root;
The next elements should be the values of the nodes at height 1 (i.e. the root children), ordered from the leftmost to the rightmost one;
The elements after that should be the values of the nodes at height 2 (i.e. the children of the nodes at height 1) ordered in the same way;
Etc.
