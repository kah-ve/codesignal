Note: Your solution should have O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of element in l, and O(1) additional space complexity, since this is what you would be asked to accomplish in an interview.

Given a linked list l, reverse its nodes k at a time and return the modified list. k is a positive integer that is less than or equal to the length of l. If the number of nodes in the linked list is not a multiple of k, then the nodes that are left out at the end should remain as-is.

You may not alter the values in the nodes - only the nodes themselves can be changed.

Example

For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 2, the output should be
reverseNodesInKGroups(l, k) = [2, 1, 4, 3, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 1, the output should be
reverseNodesInKGroups(l, k) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
For l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and k = 3, the output should be
reverseNodesInKGroups(l, k) = [3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7, 10, 11].
